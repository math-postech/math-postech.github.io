## About This Seminar

We will hold a number theory learning seminar this semester on **Geometric Satake**. The aim is to deepen our understanding of perverse sheaves and apply this framework to the study of Geometric Satake, a central topic for entering the theory of geometric Langlands and categorical Langlands.

The organizer will outline the schedule and deliver an introductory lecture at the first meeting.

All are welcome to attend.
