## 3. Course Objectives

```
This course develops linear algebra through a simplified approach emphasising applications to machine learning and statistics centered on the cross-filling method (rank-one decomposition) that simplifies traditional Gaussian elimination with boarder applications to other application areas.

Covered topics include:
• Matrix computation strategies: Cross-filling, sum ↔ product equivalence
• Vector spaces and subspaces: Null space, column space, the four fundamental subspaces
• Projection theory: Oblique and orthogonal projections, compatible families, spectral decompositions
• Determinants: Axiomatic properties, Laplace expansion, Cayley-Hamilton theorem
• Eigenvalues and spectral decomposition: Lagrange interpolation approach to diagonalization
• Normal matrices and applications: Hermitian/unitary matrices, positive definiteness, singular value decomposition (SVD)

Applications include:
• Multi-variable Linear Regression and Data Analysis
• Differential Equations

Pedagogical note: This curriculum uses cross-filling and Lagrange interpolation as primary computational methods, offering alternative and often more elegant techniques than traditional approaches.
