### Mar. 20 - Matteo Mucciconi (National University of Singapore)
**Title:** Multiplicative Averages of Plancherel Random Partitions: Elliptic Functions, Phase Transitions, and Applications

**Abstract:**

We consider random integer partitions~$\lambda$ that follow the Poissonized Plancherel measure of parameter~$t^2$.
Using Riemann--Hilbert techniques, we establish the asymptotics of the multiplicative averages
\[
    Q(t,s)=\mathbb{E} \left[ \prod_{i\ge 1} \left(1+e^{\eta(\lambda_i-i+\frac 12-s)}\right)^{-1} \right]
\]
for fixed $\eta>0$ in the regime $t\to+\infty$ and $s/t=O(1)$.
We compute the large-$t$ expansion of $\log Q(t,xt)$ expressing the rate function $\mathcal{F}(x) = -\lim_{t \to \infty}  t^{-2}\log Q(t,xt)$ and the subsequent divergent and oscillatory contributions explicitly in terms of elliptic theta functions.
The associated equilibrium measure presents, in general, nontrivial saturated regions and it undergoes two third-order phase transitions of different nature which we describe.
Applications of our results include an explicit characterization of tail probabilities of the height function of the $q$-deformed polynuclear growth model and of the edge of the positive-temperature discrete Bessel process and asymptotics of radially symmetric solutions to the 2D~Toda equation with step-like initial data.

### Apr. 24 - Byung Hee An (Kyungpook National University)
**Title:** Cluster structures of Legendrian cablings

**Abstract:**

It is known that both augmentation varieties and moduli spaces of constructible sheaves admit $\mathcal{A}$ and $\mathcal{X}$ cluster structures, respectively, for a certain class of Legendrian knots and links. The first known such a class is a positive braid closure by Shen-Weng, which can be seen as a cabling (or a satellite) along the boundary of the Lagrangian disk properly embedded in the four-ball.

In the first part of the talk, we generalize this viewpoint to the class of cablings along the boundary of compact orientable surfaces $L$ regarded as a Lagrangian in its cotangent bundle and consider algebraic and geometric objects associated with those Legendrians such as augmentation varieties $Aug_L(\beta)$, moduli spaces of sheaves $Sh_L(\beta)$, and so on. We show that both $Aug_L(\beta)$ and $Sh_L(\beta)$ admit cluster structures under the certain conditions,

In the second part, we consider a companion link $S(\lambda,\beta)$ of a positive braid closure $\lambda$ with the cabling data $\beta$. When $\lambda$ admits a Lagrangian filling $L$, then we discuss how $Aug_L(\beta), Aug(S(\lambda,\beta))$ and $Aug(\lambda)$ (or $Sh_L(\beta), Sh(S(\lambda,\beta))$ and $Sh(\lambda)$), and their cluster structures are related to each other.

In particular, we also provide an algorithmic way in terms of $N$-graphs to describe the relationship between Lagrangian fillings of $\beta$ over $L$, and $S(\lambda,\beta), \lambda$ over the disc.

This is a joint work in progress with Youngjin Bae(INU).

**Title:** Advancing combinatorics and number theory with AI

**Abstract:**

In this talk, I will discuss how machine learning techniques and AI tools can be applied to datasets arising in combinatorics and number theory, with the goal of uncovering hidden structures, generating conjectures, and guiding mathematical exploration.
